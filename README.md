# Flowers-Classification-using-Pytorch
### An Image Classifier to recognize different species of Flowers

In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories, https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html

The project is broken down into multiple steps:
1) Load and preprocess the image dataset
2) Train the image classifier on your dataset
3) Use the trained classifier to predict image content
